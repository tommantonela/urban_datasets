Datasets to be used in the fusion activity

* Data from Buenos Aires: transport, trash, government, crime, taxis, bikes, and a lot more!

* GeoLife Trajectory Dataset: a GPS trajectory dataset collected by Microsoft Research Asia by 167 users in a period of over two years (from April 2007 to Dec. 2010). This trajectory dataset can be used for many research theme, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition, location-based social networks, location privacy, and location recommendation.

* Noise complaint data and geographical data of NYC: This package is comprised of three parts of data. 1) tensors representing the 311 complaints on urban noise; 2) geographical feature of each region in NYC; 3) Real noise levels of 36 locations in NYC. Please cite the following two papers when using the dataset.

* Air quality data, meteorological data and weather forecasts of 43 cities in China. The dataset was used for air quality forecast and real-time inference. It also can be used for test cross-domain data fusion methods.

* Bike Sharing data coupled with weather conditions. The dataset contains bike usage (denoted by the number of check-outs and check-ins) at each bike sharing station in NYC and Chicago. The weather condition data during the period, in which the bike sharing data is collected, is also shared.

* Three datasets for detecting collective anomalies: This dataset is comprised of five parts of data, named Taxi Trip Data, Bike sharing data, 311 data, POIs and road network data of NYC.

* Inflow and outflow of crowds in each and every region of a city: This data set consists of two types of crowd flows. One is a five-year taxis flow in Beijing. The other is bike usage in a bike sharing system in New York City. A research on predicting flow of crowds have been conducted based on this dataset. Please cite the following paper when using the dataset.
